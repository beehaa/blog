### About the blog

I anticipate this blog to be about most things data (data engineering, ML/AI, and software development) with a few sprinkles of lifestyle and personal topics that interest me.

### About Me

Hello! I'm Brian Ha and the author of this personal blog. I am a data nerd who loves all things data and want to share my learning journey with like-minded people.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Boston College (Go Eagles!), where I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and economics. After spending two years in data analytics consulting, I pursued a master's degree in computer science from the University of California, Irvine (Zot Zot Zot) and have since been working in the data engineering space.
